# Scherzo – a music notation language and toolbox

Scherzo is a set of tools for working with Western classical music notation.

It comprises of an implementation of an experimental music type setting language Alma (named after the pianist and composer Alma Mahler).

The plan is to support translating Alma to and from various other music notation formats – especially LilyPond. Alma is supposed to be easier to type, edit and read than Lilypond. THe language syntax is configurable and it supports laying out simultaneously played sections of music so taht they are visually aligned.

Alma is expected to be especially convenient for composers and people using braille.

Scherzo is in very early stages of development. It cannot yet be used for anything. Developers are welcome to join.
